# PowerShell-Catalogue
Collection of PowerShell scripts for various functions

Here are the rules of the catalogue

# Rule #1 - Everyone

If you don't understand what the script will do, don't run it

# Rule #2 - Contributers

Generalise your code where-ever possible. Try not to include details specific to one environment, such as usernames, passwords or UNC paths. Where this is unavoidable, comment your code accordingly with a sufficiently visible warning.
Where possible/practical use Classes & Functions to make reading code easier.

Sensible variable, class and function naming is a must for changes to be approved.

# Rule #3 - Everyone

If you find a fault, or notice something that can be improved, create a bug/feature report so that everyone can track the changes made and hopefully learn from updates and revisions.
